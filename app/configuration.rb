#- Something I was toying with for a minute, but I'm not going to think
#  about until after I revamp and integrate the nokogiri logic some more.

#- There is a Global class for global, hard-coded configurations.
#  And then we have database.yml.

#  database.yml is a user-level configuration, and I may develop another
#  user-level config system for scraping. But I'm not there yet...

#  This class wouldn't be another place to stuff configuration settings,
#  but an object-oriented way of dealing with configurations. If need be...

class Configuration
#  require './modeller'
#
#  def initialize(options = {})
#    for option in options
#      raise "#{option} takes a Hash" unless option.instance_of? Hash
#    end
#
#    
#  end

end
